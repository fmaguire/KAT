KAT Changelog


===========================================

V1.0.5 - 28th April 2014

Removed call to auto configure when running the autogen.sh script.

Fixed issue where title could not be overriden by the user in the plotting
tools.

Changed short option name for the "list" option in spectra-mx plot tool to
'c'.  This is to avoid a conflict with the "title" option.

Provided a more descriptive error message if the user enters a malformed
value for the "list" option in the spectra-mx tool.

Removed call to set the size ratio to 1 in the spectra-mx tool

===========================================

V1.0.4 (internal release) - 1st April 2014

Dropped autoconf version to 2.59 to allow KAT to run in more environments.

Changed floats to doubles in sect.  Previously, we may have got imprecise
mean coverage estimates when using really big sequences, such as whole
chromosome length.

Fixed spectra-cn issue, where we were not including all high copy kmers in a
final band of the spectra-cn plot.

===========================================

V1.0.3 - 28th November 2013

Fixed an overflow bug with SECT, where sequences of over 64K in length, were
not handled correctly.

Fixed an issue with the gnuplot handler, which prevented compilation on Mac

Added and fixed unit tests.  Unit tests can now be run by typing "make check"
assuming the boost unit test framework is installed.

Overhauled build system.  Added more dependency checks.  Added ability to
access dependencies in non-standard locations.  Removed auto-generated files
from repository (configure script can be regenerated with "autogen.sh")

===========================================

V1.0.2 - 8th October 2013

Fix to installation procedure when cloning a fresh repository.
 - Modified compiler options so that -all-static is off
 - Added Makefile.in to git repo
 - Modified README to emphasise that only 1.1.10 works with this version.

Fix to spectra-hist so that x-max can be properly adjusted when logscale is on

===========================================
